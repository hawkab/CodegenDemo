# Codegen Demo
### Demonstrating of code generation
EN | [RU](README_ru.md)

This application is an example of the implementation of automatic generation of Spring WebClient based on existing @RestController.

The multi-module application consists of two modules:
> #### Module [client](client/README.md)
> Generated clients that can later be connected as SDK in other services for integration with this service.

> #### Module [service](service/README.md)
> Contains @RestController, DTOs, etc.
